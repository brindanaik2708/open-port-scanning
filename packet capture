# Task 1 — Packet Capture During Focused Scan

## 📌 Host Scanned
IP Address: 192.168.20.10  
Ports scanned: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP)  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Nmap (for port scanning)  
- Wireshark (for packet capture)  

## 🚀 Steps Followed
1. Opened Wireshark and selected my network interface (Wi-Fi / Ethernet).  
2. Started capture in Wireshark.  
   - Optional display filter: `ip.addr == 192.168.20.10`  
3. In a terminal, ran the focused Nmap scan:
nmap -sS -p 22,80 192.168.20.10
4. After the scan finished, stopped capture in Wireshark.  
5. Saved the capture file as:
packet capture/open-port-scanning.pcap


## 📸 Screenshot / Packet Observation


"TCP handshake observed: SYN sent from my PC, SYN-ACK received from target, indicating port is open."

## 📝 Notes
- Port 22 (SSH) and 80 (HTTP) were scanned. Open ports can be seen from SYN/SYN-ACK packets.  
- `.pcap` files are sensitive; only open in Wireshark and do not share publicly.
