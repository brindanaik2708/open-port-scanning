# Task 1 ‚Äî Risk Analysis of Open Ports

## üîç What to Look For
When analyzing scan results, check each open port for:
1. **Service Identification**  
   - Which service is running? (e.g., SSH, HTTP, SMB, MySQL)  
   - Is the version outdated or vulnerable?

2. **Exposure**  
   - Is the port needed for normal operations?  
   - Is it exposed to the whole network or only internal devices?  

3. **Authentication & Encryption**  
   - Does the service require login (e.g., SSH, FTP)?  
   - Is the traffic encrypted (HTTPS, SSH) or plaintext (HTTP, Telnet, FTP)?  

4. **Known Vulnerabilities**  
   - Some services are frequently exploited (e.g., SMBv1, Telnet, RDP).  
   - Check if the service/version has known CVEs.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Severity Rating Guide
Use this simple **Low / Medium / High** scale for student projects:

- **Low** üîµ  
  - Service is common and safe if configured properly.  
  - Example: HTTP (80) open on a web server with no sensitive data.  

- **Medium** üü†  
  - Service requires authentication but may be misconfigured.  
  - Example: SSH (22) with password login enabled.  
  - Risk increases if default/weak credentials are used.  

- **High** üî¥  
  - Known vulnerable service or dangerous exposure.  
  - Example: SMB (445) open with SMBv1, or database exposed to the internet.  
  - Can allow remote code execution, data theft, or full system compromise.

## üìù Example Severity Assignment

| IP            | Port | Service | Severity | Reason |
|---------------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| 192.168.20.1  | 80   | HTTP    | Low      | Router admin page (ok if password changed) |
| 192.168.20.5  | 22   | SSH     | Medium   | SSH enabled, should use key-based auth only |
| 192.168.20.10 | 445  | SMB     | High     | SMBv1 detected, vulnerable to exploits |

## ‚úÖ Recommendations
- **Close** ports that are not required.  
- **Patch/Update** outdated services.  
- **Enforce Strong Authentication** (use SSH keys, disable default passwords).  
- **Encrypt** traffic wherever possible (prefer HTTPS over HTTP).  
- **Monitor** logs for suspicious activity.
